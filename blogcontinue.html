      <p>I have been observing my humans drop their clothes into this square shaped hole and I decided to investigate. Turns out it's some kind of narrow black whole. I still can't figure out where the clothes are going. We might never know. At least it has a comfy ledge!</p>

      <p>What do cats do when their owners aren't at home? We dim the lights, turn on the tv, and watch whatever is on Roku for 5 hours. I'm currently getting into <em>Bridgerton</em> and completing my second full watch of <em>Schitts Creek</em>. Bobbi is a huge fan of <em>Scooby Doo Where are You?</em> and any true crime series.</p>

      <h2>My Human the Designer</h2>
      <h3>Oct 02, 2024</h3>
    <div class="ex1">
      <img src="stretch-cat.jpg" width="35%">
    </div>
      <p>Because Amelia is also in college, I have a lot of free time to explore my new house. Every day I wake up the nearest human in the house to get me some food. Then I spend the rest of the day napping, grooming myself, and napping again. When my human is at home, I'm typically cuddling her or biting her fingers (don’t worry, she’s ok with it!). But enough about my interests, let's get into how I got here.  In addition to sleeping and eating a girl has to have a few hobbies.  Mine include messing with my 4-legged siblings, turning anything smaller than me into a toy and chasing it around the house, eating my food and everyone else’s, drinking from great big bowls that the humans sit on, and, recently, blogging. I decided to start blogging after I stumbled on Amelia’s laptop while she was asleep. By stumbled on I mean I walked on it, and suddenly there were noises, lights, and words.  It was almost magic! I think my human may be correct – I may be the smartest cat ever!  Alas, a blog was born!

      <h2>Yummy!</h2>
      <h5>Feb 14, 2024</h5>
    <div class="ex1">
      <img src="pb-and-j.jpg" width="50%">
    </div>
      <p>Sometimes cat food is just too boring. The stuff my human eats is way better! I think she called it a PB and J? Whatever it is, it's sooooo good! Much better than that dumpling I managed to snatch yesterday. My human's sister Katheryn managed to capture a video of my amazing feat.</p>
      <div class="ex1">

</div>
      <p>However, My tastes go beyond traditional cat food and the occasional stolen dumpling. As a cat with a discerning palate, I must express my uncontainable love for the delightful world of food by trying everything that comes my way! Each meal is a thrilling adventure, a tantalizing exploration of flavors that dances on my taste buds. The moment my human serves me my plates, I am filled with pure joy, ready to pounce on that plate it’s a treasure chest. Whether it’s the savory crunch of kibble, the creamy decadence of wet food, the mouthwatering taste of sliced turkey, the creamy sweetness of ice cream, or a chunk of bread, every bite is a celebration of life. Truly, my love for food knows no bounds, and each mealtime is a glorious feast fit for royalty—because let’s face it, I am the queen of this castle!</p>

      <p> I don't know what's wrong with me, but I feel horrible. Amelia and Marcy took me to my old foster agency then the next thing I know, I get a pinch in my butt and the world goes black. When I finally I wake up, I feel like I was put in a trash compacter. My stomach hurts the worst, like I was punched 500 times! I probably won't be posting for at least a week. I need time to recover from whatever the heck was done to me.</p>
